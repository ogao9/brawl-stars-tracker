# brawl-stars-tracker

## What does it do?
The Brawl Stars Tracker tracks the trophy progress of multiple players in the mobile game Brawl Stars. I created this because I was involved in a trophy-gaining competition with a group of friends, and we wanted a way to track our progress and standings without needing to pull out a calculator every time.

## Technologies Used
+ Python
+ Brawl Stars API (to fetch data)
+ Pandas Dataframes (to store data)
+ Seaborn (to make nice-looking charts)

## Future Improvement
I hope to add graphs that depict the trophy progress over a long period of time (similar to the charts that track stock prices).
